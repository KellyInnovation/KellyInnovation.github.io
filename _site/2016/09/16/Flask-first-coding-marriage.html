<h2 class="post">Flask: A First Marriage of Coding Languages</h2>
<h4 class="post">Sep 16, 2016</h4>
<p class="blog-post-content"><p>Having recently been to my sister’s wedding, I can appreciate this week’s marriage of HTML, CSS, and Python via Flask.</p>

<p>We spent the first week focusing on HTML and CSS.  Creating something visual appealed to my more artistic side.  With HTML and CSS, I wanted to focus on aesthetics and user focused layouts to my information.  This first introduction to coding is the one I have now know the longest.  This is comparable to my sister.</p>

<p>The next two weeks focused on python based programming.  I appreciated the new functionality available through python.  The problem solving inherent to python coding appeals to my technical mindset.  A favorite during this learning was the text-based adventure game.  Creating something with python that had functionality was exciting.  This addition of python was like the introduction to my sister’s future husband.</p>

<p>While both my sister and her fiancé were each great on their own, HTML, CSS, and python are all similarly useful separately.  These are, however, even better together.  With my sister’s marriage, I gained not only a brother-in-law, but also his entire family into mine (about which my daughter is thrilled).  I also know my sister now has a stronger foundation for her future through her husbands support.  They can do so much together than either one could do separately.</p>

<p>Similar to my sister’s marriage, Flask’s combining of all three languages is significantly more powerful than any of the languages alone.  I can finally combine functionality (python) with aesthetics (HTML and CSS).  As with my sister’s marriage, I gained more than just the marriage of these languages.  I also gained new features, such as forms, to make the whole process more efficient.  I look forward to learning the next sets of tools (Django) to better marry the languages we already have.  May these marriages be long and happy.</p>
