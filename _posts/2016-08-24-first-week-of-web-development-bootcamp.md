title: My First Week in Web Development Bootcamp
---

Looking for a change in career with more creativity, innovation, and learning, I  joined the ![Web Development Bootcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_Bootcamp "Web Development Bootcamp") at ![Awesome Inc](https://www.awesomeinc.org/ "Awesome Inc") in Lexington, KY.

As of day three, web development promises to combine multiple interests for me and provide a fulfilling career.  It can be at times frustrating (Javascript while loops), but also satisfying to solve problems with existing code, or create new code to create something new.
