title: My First Week of Bootcamp
---

Looking for a change in career with more creativity, innovation, and learning, I  joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_Bootcamp">Web Development Bootcamp</a> at <a href="https://www.awesomeinc.org">Awesome Inc</a> in Lexington, KY.

As of day three, web development promises to combine multiple interests for me and provide a fulfilling career.  It can be at times frustrating (Javascript while loops), but also satisfying to solve problems with existing code, or create new code to create something new.

I enjoy seeing front-end results with HTML and CSS, and Jekyll is making changes easier.
