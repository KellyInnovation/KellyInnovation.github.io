<p>I&#39;m Kelly Wright.  I was an analytical chemist for 9 years, but am transitioning to web development.  My husband (Brian) and I have a daughter (Kaitlyn).  Before Kaitlyn, I enjoyed whitewater kayaking, martial arts, skiing and snowboarding.  Now, I enjoy spending time with Kaitlyn, reading, quilting, and going to Bible study.  In my career, I want to utilize technical skills, solve problems, and incorporate creativity and innovation.
